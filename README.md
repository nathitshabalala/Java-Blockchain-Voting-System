# Project: Blockchain Voting System – Ensuring Secure and Transparent Elections

I'm proud to share my work on a **Blockchain Voting System**, designed to bring greater transparency, security, and accessibility to the voting process. This project leverages blockchain's decentralized and tamper-resistant features to address challenges in traditional voting methods, such as vulnerability to fraud and lack of transparency. By enabling voters to cast ballots securely from their personal devices, this system modernizes elections while prioritizing privacy and integrity.

- **Anonymity & Privacy**: Votes are cast and stored anonymously, ensuring voter privacy and confidence in the process.
- **Error Handling & Verification**: A queue system addresses potential errors, while a proof-of-state mechanism ensures only verified votes are counted.

## Tech Stack

- **Blockchain Framework**: Java Blockchain jar for encryption, hashing, and data verification
- **Frontend**: JavaFX
- **Backend**: Java
